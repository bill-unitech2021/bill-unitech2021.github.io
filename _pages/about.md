Welcome! I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to the Aviation Industry. I am also an assistant
researcher with the [Digital Testbed Air Cargo](https://www.digital-testbed-air-cargo.com/) project and a PhD student at [Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences](https://www.frankfurt-university.de/), currently working at [House of Logistics and Mobility](https://frankfurt-holm.de/).


I earned my MSc in Computer Science from the
[University *of* Electronic Science and Technology of China *at* Chengdu](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and my
BSc in Communication Engineering from [Chengdu University of Infomation Technology](https://www.cuit.edu.cn/). I've been teaching at the [Civil Aviation Flight University of China](https://www.cafuc.edu.cn/english1/Home.htm) in Chengdu since September 2014. My primary focus revolves around the construction of a Navigational Database, utilizing Python for numerical and scientific computations. In addition to my technical work, I also play an educational role. I've established a course on Computer Networks specifically tailored for students pursuing Navigation Engineering. This involves teaching two crucial classes: [*Instrument Flight Procedure*](https://www.icao.int/safety/OPS/OPS-Section/Pages/flightprocedure.aspx#:~:text=Instrument%20flight%20procedures%20(IFP)%20are,component%20of%20the%20aviation%20system.) and [*Communication, Navigation and Surveillance System*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication,_navigation_and_surveillance). I spend a year working on a Bais and Non-inclusive languge project in the cross-domain of data science and law at Maastricht University, Netherlands before my transfer to [Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences](https://www.frankfurt-university.de/).
