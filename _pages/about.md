Welcome! I am a data scientist applying machine learning tools and causal
inference techniques to the Aviation Industry. I am also an assistant
researcher with the [Digital Testbed Air Cargo](https://www.digital-testbed-air-cargo.com/)
and a PhD student at [Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences](https://www.frankfurt-university.de/).



I earned my MSc in Computer Science from the
[University *of* Electronic Science and Technology of China *at* Chengdu](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and my
BSc in Communication Engineering from [Chengdu University of Infomation Technology](https://www.cuit.edu.cn/).

I've been teaching at the [Civil Aviation Flight University of China](https://www.cafuc.edu.cn/english1/Home.htm) in Chengdu since September 2014. My primary focus revolves around the construction of a Navigational Database, utilizing Python for numerical and scientific computations. In addition to my technical work, I also play an educational role. I've established a course on Computer Networks specifically tailored for students pursuing Navigation Engineering. This involves teaching two crucial classes: *Instrument Flight Procedure* and *Communication, Navigation and Surveillance System*.
